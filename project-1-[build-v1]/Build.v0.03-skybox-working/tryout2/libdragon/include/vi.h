 * @file vi.h
 * @brief Video Interface Subsystem
 * @ingroup display
 * 
 * This module offers a low-level interface to VI programming. Most applications
 * should use display.h, which sits on top of vi.h, and offers a higher level
 * interface, plus automatic memory management of multiple framebuffers,
 * FPS utilities, and much more.
 * 
 * ## Register read/write access
 * 
 * This module defines a set of macros to directly access the VI registers,
 * including macros to compose different fields in the registers. While read
 * access is straightforward, write access is generally more complicated
 * because VI is quite picky about the timing of register writes: most registers
 * can only be written during vblank. 
 * 
 * To help with that, this module provides a set of functions to write registers
 * that will be applied at the next vblank: #vi_write and #vi_write_masked.
 * To batch multiple register writes, you can use #vi_write_begin and #vi_write_end,
 * so that you can be sure that all the registers will be written atomically
 * at the next vblank.
 * 
 * #vi_read can be used to read the current state of a register, including any
 * pending changes (applied via #vi_write) that were not yet applied.
 * 
 * ## Higher level APIs
 * 
 * This module also includes some higher level APIs to configure the VI:
 * 
 * * #vi_show is a simple function to just show a #surface_t to the screen.
 * * #vi_set_origin, #vi_set_xscale and #vi_set_yscale are more granular
 *   functions to configure the framebuffer.
 * * #vi_set_aa_mode, #vi_set_divot, #vi_set_dedither and #vi_set_gamma
 *   are functions to configure various filters and modes of the VI.
 * * #vi_set_interlaced is a function to turn on and off interlaced display mode.
 * * #vi_set_output defines the active display area on the screen.
 *   #vi_get_output_bounds will provide the limits for it, while
 *   #vi_move_output and #vi_scroll_output can be used to just pan the display.
 * * #vi_set_borders is an alternative to #vi_set_output, that specifies the
 *   display area in terms of borders (with respect to the default one).
 * 
 * ## Active display area and framebuffer scaling
 * 
 * VI has a powerful resampling engine: the framebuffer is not displayed as-is
 * on TV, but it is actually resampled (scaled, stretched), optionally with
 * bilinear filtering. This is a very powerful hardware feature that is a bit
 * complicated to configure, so an effort was made to expose an intuitive API
 * to programmers.
 *
 * By default, this module configures the VI to resample an arbitrary framebuffer
 * picture into a virtual 640x480 display output with 4:3 aspect ratio (on NTSC
 * and MPAL), or a virtual 640x576 display output though with the same 4:3
 * aspect ratio on PAL. This is done to achieve TV type independence: since
 * both resolution share the same aspect ratio on their respective TV standards
 * (given that dots are square on NTSC but they are not on PAL), it means
 * that the framebuffer will look the same on all TVs; on PAL, you will be
 * trading additional vertical resolution (assuming the framebuffer is big
 * enough to have that detail). 
 * 
 * This also means that games don't have to do anything special to handle NTSC
 * vs PAL (besides maybe accounting for the different refresh rate), which is
 * an important goal.
 * 
 * In reality, TVs didn't have a 480-lines vertical resolution so the actual
 * output depends on whether you request interlaced display or not:
 * 
 *  * In case of non interlaced display, the actual resolution is 640x240, but
 *    since dots will be configured to be twice as big vertically, the aspect
 *    ratio will be 4:3 as-if the image was 640x480 (with duplicated scanlines)
 *  * In case of interlaced display, you do get to display 480 scanlines, by
 *    alternating two slightly-shifted 640x240 pictures.
 * 
 * As an example, if you configure a framebuffer resolution like 512x320, with
 * interlacing turned off, what happens is that the image gets scaled into
 * 640x240, so horizontally some pixels will be duplicated to enlarge the
 * resolution to 640, but vertically some scanlines will be dropped. The
 * output display aspect ratio will still be 4:3, which is not the source aspect
 * ratio of the framebuffer (512 / 320 = 1.6666 = 16:10), so the image will
 * appear squished, unless obviously this was accounted for while drawing to
 * the framebuffer.
 * 
 * While resampling the framebuffer into the display output, the VI can use either
 * bilinear filtering or simple nearest sampling (duplicating or dropping pixels).
 * See #vi_aa_mode_t for more information on configuring the VI image filters.
 * 
 * The 640x480 virtual display output can be fully viewed on emulators and on
 * modern screens (via grabbers, converters, etc.). When displaying on old
 * CRTs though, part of the display will be hidden because of the overscan.
 * To account for this, you can configure a smaller display output via two
 * different APIs which are just two ways to express the same concept:
 * 
 *  * #vi_set_borders: this function configures the display output on the screen
 *    by specifying the size of the borders, with respect to the default 640x480
 *    display output.
 *  * #vi_set_output: this function configures the display output on the screen
 *    by specifying the top-left and bottom-right corners of the display area,
 *    as absolute coordinates in the VI coordinate system.
 * 
 * For instance, if you specify 12 dots of borders on all the four edges, you
 * will get a 616x456 display output (on NTSC), plus the requested 12 dots of
 * borders on all sides; The same effect can be obtained by specifying the
 * display output area as (120, 47) - (736, 503) with #vi_set_output. This
 * is because the default display area on NTSC is (108, 35) - (748, 515)
 * (which can be found out via #vi_get_output).
 * 
 * Notice that adding borders also affects the aspect ratio of the display output;
 * for instance, in the above example, the 616x456 display output is not
 * exactly 4:3 anymore, but more like 4.05:3. By carefully calculating borders,
 * thus, it is possible to obtain specific display outputs with custom aspect
 * ratios (eg: 16:9).
 * 
 * To help calculating the borders by taking both potential goals into account
 * (overscan compensation and aspect ratio changes), you can use #vi_calc_borders.
 * 
 * ## Working with interrupts disabled
 * 
 * Sometimes, the VI library can be used in highly specified contexts where
 * interrupts are disabled (special test ROMs, emergency debug outputs, etc.)
 * 
 * In these cases, after you change any setting with this library (eg: 
 * call #vi_show to display a new buffer), you must also call #vi_wait_vblank.
 * This will block execution until the next vblank happens, and at that point
 * all pending VI settings will also be applied. 
 * 
 * Normally, this is not necessary as interrupts are used to synchronize with
 * vblank. But missing that possibility, the synchronization must be performed
 * explicitly via #vi_wait_vblank.

/**
 * @brief Video Interface borders structure

 * This structure defines how thick (in dots) should the borders around

 * 
 * The dots refer to the VI virtual display output (640x480, on both NTSC, PAL,
 * and M-PAL), and thus reduce the actual display output, and even potentially
 * modify the aspect ratio. The framebuffer will be scaled to fit under them.
 * 
 * For example, when displaying on CRT TVs, one can add borders around a
 * framebuffer so that the whole image can be seen on the screen. 
 * 
 * If no borders are applied, the output will use the entire virtual dsplay
 * output (640x480) for showing a framebuffer. This is useful for emulators,
 * upscalers, and LCD TVs.
 * 
 * Notice that borders can also be *negative*: this obtains the effect of
 * actually enlarging the output, growing from 640x480. Doing so will very
 * likely create problems with most TV grabbers and upscalers, but it might
 * work correctly on most CRTs (though the added pixels will surely be
 * part of the overscan so not really visible). Horizontally, the maximum display
 * output will probably be ~700-ish on CRTs, after which the sync will be lost.
 * Vertically, any negative number will likely create immediate syncing problems,
