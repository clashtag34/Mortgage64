 * @brief Library to generate NTSC EIA-608 closed captions
 * @ingroup display
 *
 * This module provides a simple way to generate EIA-608 closed captions
 * for NTSC video signals. The EIA-608 standard defines a way to transmit
 * text data over the vertical blanking interval of an NTSC video signal.
 * 
 * The N64 VI is powerful enough that it can be programmed to emit a
 * EIA-608 compliant signal, while still displaying a framebuffer. This module
 * offers a simple API to implement that.
 * 
 * To generate caption, first initialize the module at boot via #eia608_init.
 * 
 * Once the video mode has been fully configured via either #display_init
 * or via the VI library, you can start generating captions by calling
 * #eia608_start. This function will perform calculations to inject the
 * EIA-608 signal into the video signal, so it is important to call it
 * after all VI configurations have been performed. If you need to perform
 * *any* change to VI configuration, make sure to call #eia608_stop first,
 * and then call #eia608_start again.
 * 
 * To generate captions, you can use #eia608_caption_prepare and #eia608_caption_show
 * to display a UTF-8 string on the screen. These functions will take care of
 * encoding the string into EIA-608 format, doing some basic formatting (word-wrap,
 * and centering), and hiding it after the specified number of seconds.
 * 
 * This module also provides a way to display raw EIA-608 data, via
 * #eia608_write_raw. One possible use case for this function is to
 * display captions saved into the Scenarist SCC format, which is a very
 * simple text format that encodes captions as sequence of raw 16-bit
 * EIA-608 words.
 * 
 * @note The runtime performance impact of this module is around ~100 Âµs per
 *       VI frame (so 60 Hz), irrespective of the actual game speed.
 * 
 * @note EIA-608 is a standard for NTSC video signals. It is not compatible
 *       with PAL or MPAL TVs.
 * 
 * @see Wikipedia article on EIA-608: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-608
