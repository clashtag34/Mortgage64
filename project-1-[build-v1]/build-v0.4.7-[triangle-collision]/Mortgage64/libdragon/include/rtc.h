 * @defgroup rtc Real-Time Clock Subsystem
 * @ingroup peripherals
 * @brief Real-time clock interface.
 * @author Christopher Bonhage
 *
 * The Real-Time Clock (RTC) subsystem provides a high-level interface for
 * reading and writing the real-time clock on the N64 Joybus. The Joybus RTC
 * is currently the only real-time clock supported by LibDragon. There is
 * also a real-time clock included in the N64DD and iQue hardware, which use
 * different hardware interfaces and are not yet supported by LibDragon.
 *
 * To check if a hardware real-time clock is available, call #rtc_init.
 * If no hardware real-time clock is available, the subsystem will provide
 * a software-based real-time clock for the current play session. Note that
 * this software RTC does not persist across resets or power cycles!
 *
 * Once the RTC subsystem is initialized, you can use ISO C Time functions
 * to get the current time, for example: `time(NULL)` will return the number of
 * seconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00).
 * To write a new time to the real-time clock, use the ISO C Time function
 * `settimeofday`.
 *
 * This subsystem handles decoding and encoding the date/time from its internal
 * format into a standard `struct tm` structure. You can use convert between
 * `struct tm` and `time_t` using the standard C library functions `gmtime`,
 * `mktime`, and `time`.
 *
 * In anticipation of support for the 64DD and iQue real-time clocks, the
 * subsystem has APIs that allow homebrew to specify the preferred RTC source.
 * Use #rtc_is_source_available to determine if a specific RTC source can be
 * used, and #rtc_set_source to switch between available sources. The subsystem
 * will automatically resynchronize the time with the new clock when the source
 * is changed.
 *
 * Internally, Joybus RTC cannot represent dates before 1990-01-01, although
 * some RTC implementations (like UltraPIF) only support dates after
 * 2000-01-01.
 *
 * 64DD RTC only stores two digits for the year, so conventionally 96-99 are
 * treated as 1996-1999 and 00-95 are treated as 2000-2095.
 *
 * For consistency, the RTC subsystem only supports dates between 1996-2095.
 * Attempting to set the clock beyond this range will fail. RTC subsystem
 * should only be set to the "actual" date and time, and not for
 * arbitrary time manipulation. If your game uses some form of
 * time travel or real-time clock that does not match the actual
 * date/time, you should use an offset from the actual time.
